Title: **Project Description: Implementing Clean Architecture with CQRS Pattern and JWT Authentication**

Description:
This project embodies modern software development principles, employing Clean Architecture with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern and JWT authentication. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the technologies and patterns utilized:

1. **Clean Architecture**:
   - Clean Architecture, popularized by Robert C. Martin, focuses on separating concerns within a software system to achieve better maintainability and scalability.
   - It emphasizes organizing code into distinct layers, such as Entities, Use Cases, and Interface Adapters, each with specific responsibilities and dependencies.

2. **CQRS Pattern**:
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates the responsibilities of reading data (queries) from those of writing data (commands) within a system.
   - By decoupling read and write operations, CQRS allows for scalability and optimization tailored to specific use cases.

3. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**:
   - DTOs are used to encapsulate data that needs to be transferred between different layers of the application or between the application and external systems.
   - They promote separation of concerns by defining a clear boundary between the internal domain model and external data representation.

4. **JWT Authentication**:
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication is a stateless authentication mechanism commonly used in web applications.
   - It allows users to authenticate using tokens that contain encoded information about the user and their permissions, enhancing security and scalability.

By combining these technologies and patterns, the project aims to achieve:

- **Modularity**: The application is divided into independent modules, making it easier to understand, maintain, and scale.
- **Scalability**: Through the use of CQRS, the system can scale read and write operations independently, optimizing performance.
- **Security**: JWT authentication ensures secure user authentication and authorization, safeguarding sensitive data and operations.

======================Use of project================================== 
**Update Database Server Path:**

Locate the configuration file or environment variables where the database connection information is stored.
Modify the database server path to the new desired location.
Ensure that the database server is accessible and properly configured at the new path.
